## 0x06-python-classes

Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. Classes act as blueprints, defining the structure and behavior of objects. Python's OOP features include encapsulation, allowing bundling of data and methods within a class; inheritance, facilitating code reuse and specialization; and polymorphism, enabling objects to be treated uniformly. Python's syntax supports the creation of classes, instantiation of objects, and the implementation of core OOP principles, making it a versatile language for building modular and maintainable code.
