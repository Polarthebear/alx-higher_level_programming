## 0x07-python-test_driven_development

### Brief Description
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before the actual code. The process involves creating a failing test (Red), writing the minimum code to make the test pass (Green), and then refactoring the code without changing its behavior. This iterative cycle ensures a continuous and reliable testing process throughout development, enabling early bug detection, improved code design, and increased confidence in making changes. TDD is valued for its ability to produce maintainable and robust software systems by emphasizing the importance of comprehensive test coverage.

#### Mandatory Tasks:
